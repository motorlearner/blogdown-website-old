  Hi, my name is Aslan. Here, I blog about all things science. 
  What exactly this entails is not well-defined. Probably some basic concepts related
  to data wrangling and analysis; surely some motor neuroscience (my main 
  research interest); maybe some cool stuff in `R`, `Python`, or `Julia`; and whatever
  else comes to mind. There's a nonzero chance you'll find some of it interesting. 
  Anyway, enjoy this visualization of the Fourier transform. :)
