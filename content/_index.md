  Here, I blog about all things science. What exactly that entails is not well-defined. 
  Maybe doing some cool stuff in `R` or some other language that I'm even worse at,
  probably some basic data analysis and statistics, surely some motor neuroscience since
  that's my actual field, and whatever else comes to mind. There's a nonzero chance you'll
  find some of it interesting. Anyway, enjoy this visualization of the Fourier transform. 
  Each of those 33 arrows is making an integer-number of rotations...however, if you add
  them all tip to tail, and they draw this complex red pattern!
