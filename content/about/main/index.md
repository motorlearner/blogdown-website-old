  About me 

intro: |
  Hi, my name is Aslan. I did my undergrad in Exercise Sciences at the University
  of Auckland in New Zealand, and my masters in Human Movement Sciences at the Vrije 
  University Amsterdam in The Netherlands. I hope to start a PhD soon. 
  My main interest is the neuroscience of human movement.
