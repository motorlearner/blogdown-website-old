headline: Tales of Uncertainty

---

Why the title? Any knowledge claim always comes with 
uncertainty, and is incomplete without a detailed account of said uncertainty. 
Identifying, acknowledging, and communicating uncertainty is an exercise that 
only few people master. Many neglect that part altogether and end up telling a 
fairy tale--for a tale is incomplete without its uncertainty. 
Kind of like focusing on the center of a probability distribution, 
thus neglecting its tails.
