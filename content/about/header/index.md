headline: Tales of Uncertainty

---

Why the title? Any knowledge claim always comes with 
uncertainty, and is incomplete without a detailed account of said uncertainty. 
Identifying, acknowledging, and communicating uncertainty is an exercise that 
only few people master. Many people neglect that part, instead telling a tale 
that is really a tale [full] of [neglected] uncertainty. Somewhat like focusing
on the center of a probability distribution, while neglecting its tails [of uncertainty].
