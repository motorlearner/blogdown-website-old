Statistical inference is based on probability theory. Probability has a clear definition in the abstract mathematical world: it is a number between 0 and 1, and the probability that any one of multiple mutually exclusive events occurs is the sum of their individual probabilities. But if we apply probability to our real world, what exactly does it quantify there?

The answer depends on the statistical framework. In the *frequentist* framework, probabilities refer to hypothetical long run *frequencies*. For example, when flipping a coin, the probability of heads is 0.5. That means, if we repeatedly flipped a coin, the frequency of heads would tend to 0.5 as the number of coin flips approaches infinity. A simulated version of this is shown in <b class="figreftext"> FIGURE 1</b>. 

<!-- figure: -->
<p class="figure">

</p>
<p class="caption">
  <b class="figreffig">FIGURE 1:</b>
  Three simulated coins, each flipped 3000 times. The x-axis shows the number of flips. The y-axis shows the frequency of heads for each coin. After the first flip, the frequency of heads is either 0 or 1. As the number of flips grows, the frequency of heads tends to 0.5. 
</p>

More generally, the probability that a process produces a certain outcome is the frequency at which that outcome is observed *in the long run*, i.e. *if the process is repeated infinitely often*.

In surveys, participants may be included at random, in which case the population refers to all people that could have been drawn. In trials, participants are typically not included at random but are randomly allocated to group, in which case the population refers to all possible allocations of the included participants. It is pretty rare that participants are both included and allocated at random, but in this case the population would refer to all possible allocations of all people that could have been included.
